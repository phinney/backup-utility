The User Guide was authored using Microsoft Word.
The graphics it contains are created using Microsoft Visio.

If you make changes to the documentation, you'll need to save a PDF copy of the changed documentation
in the src/main/doc folder.  The PDF version of the User Guide gets displayed in the Systems Desktop browser when
the Help MenuItem in the Help Menu get clicked.

The main/documentation folder is not placed in the projects jar file. However, the do folder is place in the
projects jar file.
